# React-voting-app

This is a small voting application that can be deployed on any machine that has Docker installed. The application is created by pulling a Docker image from Docker Hub. The image contains all the necessary files and dependencies to run the application.

This application enables user to vote for their favourite programming language. The data is then actively stored in MongoDB which can be accessed using mongo shell.
